Square's Enix, **Romancing Saga Re:Universe** just had its global released after a [small scale soft launch last week](/romancing-saga-re-universe). The highly anticipated mobile game, take place 300 years after **Romancing Saga 3** and follows the quest of Polka, a young boy who search for his sister. In his journey he will join the Grave Knights ( a knighthood organization ), make new companions and fight a lot of strange enemies. 

Apart from the charactes that you meet in the story, you can also recruit varius characters from other games of the Romancing Saga series, by pulling in the in-game gacha. The rates are pretty good and at least at the start, the game handle the in-game currency like candies. You can also pull with tickets you can get from in-game challenges like **Spiral corridor** and even farm some SS characters in some certain stages. Note that the game is full **PVE** so there is no real preasure to spend unless you want to support the developer.

Every character comes with different styles ( or skins if you preffer the term ) that changes their playstyle. However, for a given character, all styles share the same stats, that you can farm in game. Thats right, following the mechanics of the original games, your character doesnt level up but they gain stats at random during after each battle. It is not completely random, as there is a highter possibility to gain stats when fighting stronger enemies. Styles can be leveled up, affecting by a percent number the overall character stats. 

Your character power is also affected by equipment. You can equip a weapon, an armor and a trinket in each of your characters. At latter stages, you will also expected to level your character skills, thus lowering their BP cost ( mana cost ), maximizing your damage output as a result. 

So be ready for a grid. Your daily routine will be to farm daily stages for gold and other resources and clearing the higher stage you can so you can **farm stats.** Other functions you should aim for, is **the expendition**, where you send 5 of your characters in an "offline" adventure for some hours and they gain stats in return. You unlock better expenditions as you progress the game.

Even though the game is a bit "gridy", Romancing Saga Re:Universe is a very well made game, with an interesting story, beautifull characters and a deep combat system. Give it a try and i am sure it will grow on you.
