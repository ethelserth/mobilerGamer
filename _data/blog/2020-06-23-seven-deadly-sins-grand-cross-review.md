**Seven Deadle Sins : Grand Cross** is a new rpg based on the [popula manga and anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Deadly_Sins_(2014_TV_series)), created and published by Netmarble. The game already runs for the last year in Japan and finally, last March in had its global release. 

The first feauture that anyone opening the game notice, is the top notch graphics. In combat, in cut-scenes and in the general menus, everywere the game feels like you are watching the anime of the same name. Animation are smooth, character models are crystal clear and with details. It even comes with an AR mode that let you interact with Meliodas and his friends in the tavern.

The story follows the original story line, so if you are a fan be ready to relive the quest of the Sins to liberate Britania. Also it feautures a lot of extra "mini" story events and even collaborations with other popular franchises. Based on JP schedule, global should be getting a collaboration with Slime anime the following months.

In game you build a team of three active members plus one supporting member.  Its character have 3 skills, that you get at random in battle in the form of a card. You can either merge same skills to increase its rank or use it. Each character have a ultimate gauge. After a certain numbers of skill uses, the gauge fills and you can use an ultimate attack to finish your enemies. Finally each character have a passive that becomes available upon reaching level 60, that play a huge role in team members synergies.

You pull characters from a gacha by using diamonds, a currency that you can buy for dollars or farm in game.  So far the game is pretty generous with diamonds and  it even gives you some of the strongest heroes by clearing the story. Though, if you are competitive and aim for pvp, you should save and pull for the recommended characters.

To power up your characters you have to level them and also equip them with gear. Latter in the game you will be forced to farm raids with your team mates so you can level break them, so they can reach higher levels. Finaly, there is costumes, that can change a heroes look and also give them a nice stat boost.

Other feautures are guilds, unlocked after reaching a certaing point in story, Raids that are usefull to farm items used to limit break your heroes and the festival, a daily pvp arean. Throw in the various events that always are on, and you can get why some folks online remark that *Sevend Deadly Sins : Grand Cross is not a game but rather a job.*

It is true in a way. For the last weeks, when i am home, my phone seems to always run the game, be it farming for gear, doing dailies or events. But dont lets this get at you. Enjoy the game at your own pace and  you want regret it. Especially if you are fan of the franchise. 

All in all, this is a very polished game, with tons of contend and a really hight production value.
