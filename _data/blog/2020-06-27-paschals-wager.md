Paschal's Wager is a premium rpg that just released for Android. You can get it for the special launch price of 3.99â‚¬ and also benefit from an outfit  for the main character, if you download it before july 9th. 

You can get the game's tone by reading the title. Paschal's Wager refer's to the philosofical argument that humans shall lives their lives as if God exists and belive in him. If he doesnt exists then, humans have only a finite loss ( the things religions prohibits ) but in the other hand if he does exist the have inifinite gains ( afterlife in paradise etc ).  A similar moral conflict tarnish Terrence, the main character, who was banished by the church for his deeds. He now is a carrier, a warrior that protect inosents from the horrors of the world, that wanders the world with his companions. He also search for his wife, who is a witch.

The game starts with a carriage that arrives in a desserted village, pleagued by grim monsters that once upon a time, they was the church's knighs. You get the tone early.

The atmosphere is grim and gothic. In times it really gives you a Dark Souls feeling. The graphics are top notch for a mobile device. Add the game's witty music and you will be fully immerced in no time. The controls are the standard right hand attack buttons - left hand joystic, that most landscape action rpgs have on android. They are however easy to access and really fast to respond in your every command.

Except Terrence, there is three more characters that are playable. In battle you can have two characters with you. When one of them dies, the other take his place. You can develop you character's fighting prowess by varius means like talents, artifacts and stat point. All of this requires exp or loot that you get by defending monsters in the field ot by completing objectives. 

An interesting feauture is **Sanity**. While your character wanders the barren, infected world and witness the varius horror, the can lose their sanity affecting their performance. You can ofcourse stop that by drinking a potion.

The game is expected to yield around 20 hours of gameplay. Aside from the main story there is alot of in game achievements and various side quests that will keep you occupied. 

Personaly, i find Pascal's Wager one of the best release in android for a long time. It really is a premium title and a breath of a fresh air in a scene that is infected by microtranaction, gacha's and ads-to-get-resources system. Easily the best 4 bucks i have ever spend on android.
