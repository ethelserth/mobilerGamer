Weapon Masters : Roguelike is an action game similar to the popular Archero. 

It plays similira but it also comes with a lot of improvments. The visuals are more polished and controls are miles ahead of similar games. You have more control of your avatar as you can quick dodge attacks with a quick swipe, you can aim attacks over obstackles like walls by double tap and finaly you can charge up a huge attack by tap and hold motion.

The game, as the title states, is a rogulike with rpg elements. When you die, you start over but you keep your progress and the perks/items you unlocked along the way. That includes itesm that boost your stats and skills, talents that gives you permament bonus and character levels. Also there is three distinct playable characters, each with unique playstyle. You start with the original archer type hero and later, as you progress you can unlock a swordsman and a wizard. 

There is various in app purchases. There is loot boxes that you can buy to get rarer items and also you can buy energy to keep play if you spend yours. 

As of the moment there is no multiplayer or pvp elements in the game but the developers might add feautures like that in a future update.   

All in all, Weapon Masters : Roguelike is one of the best ( if not the best ) Archero clone of game. [Feel free to try it.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SuperCombo.WeaponMasters)
